    Rules page (+ attach to welcome.py) [Meg's working on it]
	Fix broken functionality jumping from main menu to rules (due to importing of class Button)
	Create a text box and add rules
	Get pictures of game grid (x3) from Ryan and add color using some Adobe product to show winning situations	

    button_gui
        Rectangles should become buttons.
        Nested infinite loops aren't good (in button_gui.ask). We're missing out on button, exit, mouse, etc. inputs.
        Click (or hover) over text boxes to input.
        Also, calling main() from an __init__ is kinda weird. Consider having __init__ only initialize values and attributes. Often main() is what contains the line of code which initializes an object (not the other way round).
        Make shift key work (capitalization)

    gamearea
        Buttons: Add some (e.g. 'quit', 'main menu' OR 'back')
        Add player names, icons.
        Make it MVC-structure.
            Restructure somewhat and begin to add gameplay mechanics (icon placement, player switching)

        "Spyder" Tic-Tac-Toe: Good name? Bad name? Name?


    Ryan's savvy business advice:
    "Butotn" could be a good name for a tech start-up.
