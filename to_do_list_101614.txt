List:
    
    Rules page (+ attach to welcome.py) [Meg's working on it]
	[x] Fix broken functionality jumping from main menu to rules (due to importing of class Button)
	[x] Create a text box and add rules
	[ ] Add color to game grids (x3) using some Adobe product (Photoshop?) to show winning
	[no] Main menu text larger on button
	[x] Wrap text (like a caveman)
	[ ] Pro: Add scrolling

    In a perfect world full of extra time,
	[ ] Scale the bugggss based on which ring they live. Inner ring makes baby bugs, outer makes BIG bugs.
	[ ] Make them rotate based on their angle

    button_gui
        Rectangles should become buttons.
        Nested infinite loops aren't good (in button_gui.ask). We're missing out on button, exit, mouse, etc. inputs.
        Click (or hover) over text boxes to input.
        Also, calling main() from an __init__ is kinda weird. Consider having __init__ only initialize values and attributes. Often main() is what contains the line of code which initializes an object (not the other way round).
        Make shift key work (capitalization)

    gamearea
        Buttons: Add some (e.g. 'quit', 'main menu' OR 'back')
        Add player names, icons.
        Make it MVC-structure.
            Restructure somewhat and begin to add gameplay mechanics (icon placement, player switching)

        "Spyder" Tic-Tac-Toe: Good name? Bad name? Name? Good name :)


    Ryan's savvy business advice:
    "Butotn" could be a good name for a tech start-up.
